## User stories

I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:

•  Title  
•  URL link  
•  Description  
•  Rating (1-5)  

•  I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app.

•  All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating.  
   -I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view.

•  Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link.  
   -I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list.

•  I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark.

•  Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required).  
   -I can select from a dropdown (a <select> element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection.
